# cab-scrape

Scraper for [Courses @ Brown](https://cab.brown.edu/), Brown University's course catalog. I use it to download a semester's worth of raw course data so that I can process the info myself and find awesome classes to take.

## TODO:

Since this is a work-in-progress project,Â here are some features that I plan to add:

- [ ] Use change-hashes and previously downloaded files to avoid re-requesting unchanged courses
- [ ] Make query criteria for CAB's API into a parameter when getting all course info
- [ ] Add more data processing/filtering features to this repo instead of separate scripts/notebooks
